	Write a wavetable to a WAV file from a set of functions generating 
	waveforms.

	Arguments:
		file: the file to write the WAV data to, either a string path 
			or a file-like object
		waves: an array of functions, each taking a floating-point phase
			between 0 and 1 and returning a sample value between -1 and 1
		wave_samples: the number of samples to be generated for each 
			waveform. For most systems this should be a power of 2. 
			For example, Ableton Live's Wavetable instrument uses 1024,
			and Xfer Serum uses 2048.
